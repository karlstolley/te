title: Late Work
---

I do not accept late work. All work must be submitted before the date and time specified in each
project description. Weekly work is due every Monday at noon, although additional mid-week deadlines
will appear in assignments posted on Basecamp, and reading-discussion threads will run for the
entire week. You should not wait until you’re done with all the reading to jump into discussion on
Basecamp; post as you’re having questions or thoughts about the reading.
