title: Copyediting Technical Material
due_date: &deadline 2021-04-08
preview: false
goals:
  - Learn to collaboratively edit and manage a small project in a team setting
  - >
    Learn to edit for internationalization and global contexts, as represented by open-source
    software projects
  - >
    Learn to work with complex technical material that may be beyond your comprehension, and edit it
    for professional audiences (the manual) and non-technical audiences (the promotional website)
  - Learn to coordinate writing and editing styles across technical and promotional materials
  - >
    Learn to go beyond the copyeditor stylesheet and prepare a style guide to be used for future
    writing within an organization
requirements:
  - You and your team must choose an open-source software project that has both a promotional or
    informational website as well as a technical manual. The instructor must approve your project
    before your team can proceed.
  - >
    You must conduct a content audit of all of a project’s technical manual pages, and its
    accompanying website. Present this as a spreadsheet that lists URLs, page titles, and a
    one-sentence content summary. (If your project’s manual is especially large, your audit should
    reflect 15 pages per team member. So a three-member team will have 45 pages listed in the
    content audit.)
  - As a team, you are responsible for editing 2500 words of a project’s technical manual
  - As a team, you are responsible for editing 1500 words of a project’s website
  - >
    You must produce an in-house style guide for the software project. The manual should cover
    language usage and style, as well as styles for headings, source code examples, etc. Use your
    project-wide stylesheet as your first draft of the style guide.

Self-selected groups of three or four students will edit an open-source software project’s
web-based technical manual and project website, both of which must be edited for content and basic
formatting. Each group will also create a short in-house style guide for the software project’s
manual and website.

To get started, each team will have to search for an open-source project's material to edit. As an
example, here is the [technical manual](https://nginx.org/en/docs/) and
[project website](https://www.nginx.com) for the NGNIX web server.
