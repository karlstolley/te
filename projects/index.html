        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          For your first project, you will choose a Wikipedia article identified
          during
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_copy_edit_from_November_2016">November 2016</a> or
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_copy_edit_from_December_2016">December 2016</a>
          as needing copyediting. You may choose any article to copyedit, provided that it:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          provides coverage of a non-technical topic. For example, the entry for Tavis Smiley would
          be a non-technical example, versus the entry for CoffeeScript.
        </li>
        <li>
          is at least 1500 words, not including references. Copy and paste the main text into a
          word processor to get a rough word count.
        </li>
        <li>
          is primarily made up of paragraph-like text, meaning that the article is not a list,
          timeline, or other short-form text.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You will create a PDF of the copy, and mark it using the basic editorial symbols covered in
        Chapter 2 of <i>The Copyeditor’s Handbook</i> (33-35).

        <h4>Project Goals</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Learn to create markable copy from web pages.
          </li>
          <li>
            Learn to edit non-technical copy with a general audience in mind.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mark copy using traditional editorial symbols outlined in <i>The Copyeditor’s
            Handbook.</i>
          </li>
          <li>
            Follow the guidance of an in-house style manual. In this case, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style">Wikipedia's Manual of Style</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create a style sheet that governs internal consistency within the article you are
            marking.

            No two students may mark the same article, so do this as soon as possible:
            <ul>
              <li>The URL to your chosen Wikipedia article marked as needing copyedits as of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_copy_edit_from_November_2016">November 2016</a> or

            An email to the instructor containing the project’s final deliverables (by Wednesday,

            <ul>
              <li>
                A Dropbox share link pointing to the PDF of your scanned, marked copy
              </li>

                A Dropbox or Google Docs link to your style sheet derived from problems and
                inconsistencies in the article

            <ul>
              <li>cover a non-technical topic</li>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Prepared in PDF format. One way to do this is to intall a readability or
                print-friendly addon/extension for your web browser. Create the PDF based on the
                output from your readability add-on of choice. Although Wikipedia provides the
                ability to download PDFs of their articles, you should learn to create
                copyediting-friendly PDFs from any website, using your own tools. We will have a
                Basecamp thread to discuss possible browsers and add-ons.

          For this project, the instructor will assign you an open-source software project’s
          web-based technical manual and project website, both of which you will edit for content
          and basic formatting. You will also create a short in-house style guide for the software

      <section class="description">
        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          You will edit a pre-publication academic manuscript for Project Three, including
          formatting its citations and reference list according to the <i>Chicago Manual of
          Style</i>. While you will of course be working on sentence-level edits, keep in mind also
          issues of style, clarity, and the consistency and overall organization of the manuscript.
          Query the author frequently; academics are a special breed when it comes to feeling
          protective of their writing.
