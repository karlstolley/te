      <h3>Project 1: Basic Marking and Copyediting <small>Due September 25</small></h3>
      <p>
        For your first project, you will choose from among the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_copy_edit_from_August_2015">Wikipedia articles
        identified during August 2015 as needing copyediting</a>. You may choose any article to
        copyedit, so long as it:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          provides coverage of a non-technical topic (e.g., the entry for James Beard would be
          a non-technical example, versus the entry for Electrocochleography)
        </li>
        <li>
          is at least 1500 words, not including references (copy and paste the main text into a
          word processor to get a rough word count)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You will create a PDF of the copy, and mark it using the basic editorial symbols covered in
        Chapter 4 of Rude and Eaton.
      </p>

      <h4>Project Goals</h4>
      <ul class="goals">
        <li>
          Learn to create markable copy from Web pages
        </li>
        <li>
          Effectively use editorial symbols outlined in Rude and Eaton for marking copy
        </li>
        <li>
          Learn to edit non-technical copy with a general audience in mind
        </li>
        <li>
          Follow the guidance of an in-house style manual (in this case, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style">Wikipedia's Manual of Style</a>)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Requirements</h4>

              desktop browser of choice, and print to PDF from the resulting Readability rendering
              of your chosen article. (Although Wikipedia provides the ability to download PDFs of
              their articles, you should learn to create copyediting-friendly PDFs from any website,

      <h3>Project 2: Editing for Academic Publication <small>Due November 6</small></h3>
      <p>
        Project 2 prepares you to edit manuscripts for academic publication. Choose a paper at the
        <a href="http://www.ssrn.com/">Social Sciences Research Network</a> (SSRN)’s <a
        href="http://www.ssrn.com/rps.html">Research Papers Series</a>. You can choose a paper from
        any of their subject areas, but the paper must be listed as appearing in a “Working Paper
        Series” (see <a
        href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/JELJOUR_Results.cfm?form_name=journalbrowse&journal_id=
        570403">this page for examples in economics</a>; what you cannot choose is a paper in the
        "Accepted Paper Series") and edit the first 4000 words and the first 20 entries of its
        bibliography/reference list. Refer to <cite>The Chicago Manual of Style</cite> for all
        matters of grammar and usage, as well as for citation.
      </p>
      <p>
        While you will of course be working on sentence-level edits, keep in mind also issues of
        style, clarity, and the overall organization of the manuscript. Query the author frequently;
        academics are a special breed when it comes to feeling protective over their writing.

        <h3>Course Description</h3>
        <p>
          This course covers the theory, principles, and intensive practice of various forms of
          editing, including basic copyediting, comprehensive editing, and proofreading. The
          course includes broad coverage of grammar and mechanics, usage and style, and the
          rhetorical dimensions of dictionaries, style guides/manuals, and other reference works.
          The course covers the traditional symbols for editorial marks on paper or paper-like
          copy (e.g., PDFs), but also offers a look at the use of wikis and version control for
          handling the editing of born-digital writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Technical editing is just one of many professional activities that occurs almost
          exclusively in a remote, digital setting. The online nature of this course emphasizes
          and reflects the importance of learning to work remotely. As an online course, Technical
          Editing is meant to be more than an opportunity for students to learn while wearing
          pajamas. Students will learn to collaborate and communicate effectively in a remote,
          digitally mediated environment for individual and group projects.

          <h3>Course Technology Policy</h3>
          <p>
            Because technology is an essential part of contemporary editing as well as online
            learning, proficiency and skill with technology is essential to your success in this
            class. Difficulty with technology is not an acceptable excuse for being unprepared for
            class.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are having trouble with technology or any other material covered in this course,
            it is your professional responsibility to do research beyond the resources and guidance
            provided in class and find materials that work for you. I also encourage all students to
            meet with me during my office hours or at another arranged time. I prefer that you
            contact me via email or GChat well in advance of assignment and project deadlines.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of that being said, I am committed to providing the most accessible online course I
            possibly can. I have gone to great lengths to make the course website accessible on
            mobile and desktop devices, for screen readers, etc. I have also chosen services for
            video, collaboration, and so on that I believe to be mobile friendly. <b>If you should
            find that any aspect of the course is not working on your phone/tablet/computer, please
            contact me immediately via email.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, I have asked you to sign up for a GitHub account for this class. Note that
            GitHub accounts are public, as are most social-type accounts. <b>To protect your privacy
            you are certainly allowed to use a pseudonym/alias for GitHub and any other account.</b>
            At the same time, you might want to think about how establishing GitHub and other
            accounts under your own name, in cases where you conduct yourself professionally, might
            actually be an asset to your online presence, and the results that future schools or
            employers turn up when they search for you on Google and elsewhere.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Weekly Assignments and Electronic Discussion</h3>
          <p>
            Your timely submission of deliverables and active participation in the electronic
            discussions for this class are required both for your own success and for
            the success of the class as a whole. However, if you absolutely must miss a discussion
            or be late with a weekly deliverable, please contact me ahead of time via email.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Academic Honesty</h3>
          <p>
            As with any course at IIT, you are expected to uphold <a href="https://web.iit.edu/student-affairs/handbook/fine-print/code-academic-honesty">the Code of Academic Honesty</a> as
            described in the
            <a href="https://web.iit.edu/student-affairs/handbook">IIT Student Handbook</a>).
            All work for this course must be your own original effort, including print and digital
            page design and computer code. Summarizations and quotations of text, as well as any use
            of open-source code libraries and images not of your own making, should be clearly cited
            as legally and ethically warranted and rhetorically appropriate. Access, storage,
            dissemination, and other use of data from third-party sources must conform to the
            source’s terms of service, licensing, and other relevant legal and ethical restrictions.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are at all uncertain as to whether you are submitting work that in whole or in
            part may violate the Code of Academic Honesty, please contact me immediately and before
            the work is due. The consequences of academic dishonesty are severe. Any student who
            violates the Code of Academic Honesty will be subject to expulsion from this course with
            a failing grade, and I will report the student to the Chair of the Department of
            Humanities, who may take additional disciplinary action, including reporting
            violations to the relevant offices of Undergraduate or Graduate Academic Affairs.
          </p>

        <li>
          <h3>Special Needs Statement</h3>
          <p>
            Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with documented disabilities. In
            order to receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter of accommodation from the
            Center for Disability Resources. The <a href="https://web.iit.edu/cdr">Center for
            Disability Resources</a> is located in IIT Tower, 3424 S. State Street - 1C3-2  (on the
            first floor). Contact the Center by telephone at 312-567-5744, by TDD at 312-567-5135,
            or via email at disabilities@iit.edu
          </p>
          <p>
            Students who have any difficulty (either permanent or temporary) that might affect their
            ability to perform in class should contact me privately, either in person or via email,
            at the start of the semester or as a documented difficulty arises. Methods, materials,
            or deadlines will be adapted as necessary to ensure equitable participation for all
            students.
