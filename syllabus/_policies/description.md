title: Course Description
---

This course covers the theory, principles, and intensive practice of various forms of editing,
including basic copyediting, comprehensive editing, and proofreading. The course includes broad
coverage of grammar and mechanics, usage and style, and the rhetorical dimensions of dictionaries,
style guides/manuals, and other reference works. The course briefly covers the traditional symbols
for editorial marks on paper or paper-like copy (e.g., PDFs), but emphasizes technologies that
support digital editing, also known as *redlining*.

Technical editing is just one of many professional activities that occurs almost exclusively in a
remote, digital setting. The online structure of this course provides you the opportunity to learn
to work remotely. Students in this course will learn to collaborate and communicate effectively in a
remote, digitally mediated environment for individual and group projects as well as weekly reading
and exercise discussions.
