        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          You will choose a Wikipedia article from a list of articles identified
          in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_copy_edit_from_November_2016">November 2016</a> or
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_copy_edit_from_December_2016">December 2016</a>
          as needing copyedits. You may choose any article to copyedit, provided that it
          covers a non-technical topic. For example, the entry for Tavis Smiley would
          be a non-technical article, versus the entry for CoffeeScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will create a PDF of the article’s copy, and mark it using the basic editorial symbols
          covered in Chapter 2 of <i>The Copyeditor’s Handbook</i> (33-35). The article you choose
          must be paragraph-like narrative text, meaning that the article should not be a
          list, timeline, or other short-form text. The article should also be at least 1500 words,
          excluding references.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Formatted as a PDF. One way to do this is to install a readability or
                print-friendly addon/extension for your web browser. You want generously sized text
                and plenty of space in between each line. Create the PDF based on the output from
                your readability add-on of choice. Although Wikipedia provides the ability to
                download PDFs of their articles, they are not well suited to copyediting. You should
                also learn to create copyediting-quality PDFs from any website, using your own
                tools. Check the Basecamp thread for discussing and recommending different add-ons.

      <section class="description">
        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          You will edit a pre-publication academic manuscript for Project Three, including
          formatting its citations and reference list or notes according to the <i>Chicago Manual of
          Style</i>. While you will of course be working on sentence-level edits, keep in mind also
          issues of style, clarity, and the consistency and overall organization of the manuscript.
          Query the author frequently; academics are a special breed when it comes to feeling
          protective of their writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will choose an in-progress article manuscript from one of two sources:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The <a href="http://www.ssrn.com/">Social Sciences Research Network</a> (SSRN) <a
            href="https://ssrn.com/en/index.cfm/rps/">Research Papers Series</a>. You can choose a
            manuscript from any of the SSRN’s subject areas, for example <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/JELJOUR_Results.cfm?form_name=journalBrowse&amp;journal_id=862725">
            this list for public policy manuscripts</a>. The paper you choose
            must be listed as appearing in a <b>Working Paper Series</b>. You cannot choose a
            paper in the Accepted Paper Series.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <a href="">Open Science Repository</a>’s
            <a href="http://www.open-science-repository.com/open-science-blog.html">Papers Open to
            Review</a>.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          You will find almost all of those papers are in PDF. You have the option either to
          clean up the PDF and present it as a Google Doc for digital redlining, or you can mark
          the PDF digitally or on paper and scan. The choice is yours.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whichever markup method you choose, you are responsible for editing the first 4000 words
          of the manuscript and the first 20 entries of its bibliography/reference list, or the
          first 20 note references, if that is the style the paper uses (in which case you would
          apply CMS note style). Refer to the <cite>Chicago Manual of Style</cite> for all matters
          of grammar and usage, as well as for citation style and formatting.
        </p>

          </li>
          <li>
            A cover letter of no more than 1-2 pages addressed to the article’s author(s)
            explaining the editing work that you have done. It should prepare them to understand the
            changes you have suggested, and alert them to global/repeated queries that require
            internal consistency throughout the manuscript. Due 11:59pm CT on Wednesday, May 3.
          </li>
          <li>
            A stylesheet that you create as you work through the manuscript to ensure its internal
            consistency. The style sheet should be comprehensible and useful for the author as well
            as anyone else involved in handling the manuscript through to publication. Be organized,
            be explicit, and of course, be consistent. Due 11:59pm CT on Wednesday, May 3.
          </li>
          <li>
            A PDF or Google Doc of your marked-up article. In-text citation should match either the
            bibliography, author-date or note style. For example, if the unedited manuscript uses a
            date-style system, use author-date. Due 11:59pm CT on Wednesday, May 3.
          </li>
          <li>
            A Google Doc of the article’s first twenty references or notes prepared according to CMS

          </li>
          <li>
            A self-critique memo that evaluates your project and your progress in the class to this
