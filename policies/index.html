      <h3>Course Description</h3>
      <p>
        This course covers the theory, principles, and intensive practice of various forms of
        editing, including basic copyediting, comprehensive editing, and proofreading. The
        course includes broad coverage of grammar and mechanics, usage and style, and the
        rhetorical dimensions of dictionaries, style guides/manuals, and other reference works.
        The course covers the traditional symbols for editorial marks on paper or paper-like
        copy (e.g., PDFs), but also offers a look at the use of wikis and version control for
        handling the editing of born-digital writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Technical editing is just one of many professional activities that occurs almost
        exclusively in a remote, digital setting. The online nature of this course emphasizes
        and reflects the importance of learning to work remotely. As an online course, Technical
        Editing is meant to be more than an opportunity for students to learn while wearing
        pajamas. Students will learn to collaborate and communicate effectively in a remote,
        digitally mediated environment for individual and group projects.
      </p>

      <h3>Assignment Submission</h3>
      <p>
        All major projects for this course will be submitted via email to the instructor, at
        karl.stolley@gmail.com. Emails should <b>not</b> include email attachments, but rather URLs
        pointing to your project in Dropbox, on Google Drive, or however indicated on the
        assignment. Weekly work will be posted to Basecamp for class discussion.
      </p>
      <h3>Late Work</h3>
      <p>
        I do not accept late work. All work must be submitted before the date and time specified
        in each project description. Weekly work is due every Monday at noon, although additional
        mid-week deadlines will appear in assignments posted on Basecamp, and reading-discussion
        threads will run for the entire week.
      </p>
      <h3>Participation</h3>
      <p>
        Your timely submission of deliverables and active participation in the electronic
        discussions for this class are required both for your own success and for the success of the
        class as a whole. I do not give reading quizzes, but I assign a lot of reading. And I expect
        you to be prepared to discuss that reading on Basecamp.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="technology-policy">
      <h3>Course Technology Policy</h3>
      <p>
        Technology is an essential part of learning and day-to-day living. It is therefore
        essential to this class. You are just as responsible for learning to command various
        technologies as for any other course content. Difficulty with technology is not an
        acceptable excuse for being unprepared for class or late with assignments.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are having trouble with technology or any other material covered in this course,
        it is your professional responsibility to do research beyond the resources and guidance
        provided in class and find supplemental materials that work for you. I also encourage
        all students to meet with me during my office hours or at another arranged time. I
        prefer that you contact me via Basecamp Ping, email, or GChat well in advance of assignment
        and project deadlines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, I have asked you to sign up for a GitHub account for this class. Note that GitHub
        accounts are public, as are most social-type accounts. <b>To protect your privacy you are
        certainly allowed to use a pseudonym/alias for GitHub and any other account.</b> You may
        also push to repositories that you keep private, so long as you add the instructor as a
        collaborator, for grading purposes. At the same time, you might want to think about the high
        value of establishing GitHub and other accounts under your own name or professional alias.
        Public accounts where you conduct yourself professionally might well be an asset to your
        online presence, improving the search results that future schools or employers turn up when
        they look for you on Google and elsewhere.

    <section id="academic-integrity">
      <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
      <p>
        As with any course at IIT, you are expected to uphold
        <a href="https://web.iit.edu/student-affairs/handbook/fine-print/code-academic-honesty">the Code of Academic Honesty</a>
        as described in the
        <a href="https://web.iit.edu/student-affairs/handbook">IIT Student Handbook</a>). All
        work for this course must be your own original effort, including print and digital page
        design and computer code. Summarizations and quotations of text, as well as any use of
        open-source code libraries and images not of your own making, should be clearly cited as
        legally and ethically warranted and rhetorically appropriate. Access, storage,
        dissemination, and other use of data from third-party sources must conform to the
        source’s terms of service, licensing, and other relevant legal and ethical restrictions.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are at all uncertain as to whether you are submitting work that in whole or in
        part may violate the Code of Academic Honesty, please contact me immediately and before
        the work is due. The consequences of academic dishonesty are severe. Any student who
        violates the Code of Academic Honesty will be subject to expulsion from this course with a
        failing grade, and I will report the student to the Chair of the Department of Humanities,
        who may take additional disciplinary action, including reporting violations to the relevant
        offices of Undergraduate or Graduate Academic Affairs.
      </p>

    <section id="special-needs">
      <h3>Special Needs Statement</h3>
      <p>
        I place a very high value on developing courses that are welcoming and accessible to all
        students. I will make additional reasonable accommodations for students with documented
        disabilities. In order to receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter of
        accommodation from the Center for Disability Resources. The <a
        href="https://web.iit.edu/cdr">Center for Disability Resources</a> is located in IIT Tower,
        3424 S. State Street - 1C3-2  (on the first floor). Contact the Center by telephone at
        312-567-5744, by TDD at 312-567-5135, or via email at disabilities@iit.edu
      </p>
      <p>
        Students who have any difficulty (either permanent or temporary) that might affect their
        ability to perform in class should contact me privately, either in person or electronically,
        at the start of the semester or as a documented difficulty arises. Methods, materials,
        or deadlines will be adapted as necessary to ensure equitable participation for all
        students.
