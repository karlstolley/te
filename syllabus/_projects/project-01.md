You will choose a Wikipedia article from
[a list of articles identified as needing copyedits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:All_articles_needing_copy_edit).
You may choose any article to copyedit, provided that the article itself still
includes a notice that it may require copyediting. The article you choose must be paragraph-like
narrative text, meaning that the article should not be a list, timeline, or other short-form text.
The article should also be at least 1000 words, excluding references.
