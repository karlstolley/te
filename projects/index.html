        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          You will choose a Wikipedia article from a list of articles identified
          in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_copy_edit_from_November_2016">November 2016</a> or
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_copy_edit_from_December_2016">December 2016</a>
          as needing copyedits. You may choose any article to copyedit, provided that it
          covers a non-technical topic. For example, the entry for Tavis Smiley would
          be a non-technical article, versus the entry for CoffeeScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will create a PDF of the article’s copy, and mark it using the basic editorial symbols
          covered in Chapter 2 of <i>The Copyeditor’s Handbook</i> (33-35). The article you choose
          must be paragraph-like narrative text, meaning that the article should not be a
          list, timeline, or other short-form text. The article should also be at least 1500 words,
          excluding references.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Formatted as a PDF. One way to do this is to install a readability or
                print-friendly addon/extension for your web browser. You want generously sized text
                and plenty of space in between each line. Create the PDF based on the output from
                your readability add-on of choice. Although Wikipedia provides the ability to
                download PDFs of their articles, they are not well suited to copyediting. You should
                also learn to create copyediting-quality PDFs from any website, using your own
                tools. Check the Basecamp thread for discussing and recommending different add-ons.

        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          You will edit a pre-publication academic manuscript for Project Three, including
          formatting its citations and reference list according to the <i>Chicago Manual of
          Style</i>. While you will of course be working on sentence-level edits, keep in mind also
          issues of style, clarity, and the consistency and overall organization of the manuscript.
          Query the author frequently; academics are a special breed when it comes to feeling
          protective of their writing.
