  - >
    Prepare an article’s reference list or notes according to the <cite>Chicago Manual of

    problems in the manuscript and ways to address them
requirements:
  - >
    Your chosen article must have at least 4000 words of body copy, excluding any figure or image
    captions, extended equations, or data tables.

    Additionally, your chosen article must contain at least 20 items in a reference list or works
    cited page, or present at least 20 references in footnote or endnote style.

    Interact with the instructor and your course colleagues on Basecamp. Post frequently as you work
    through your manuscript and encounter questions and tricky problems that would be better solved
    by seeking others’ insights.
  - >
    Mark your article for grammar and usage. Frequently query the author with questions or
    substantive suggestions.
  - >

    action: Email the instructor with your proposed article for approval.
    description: >
      The email must include the URL to your chosen article’s download page on SSRN or Open Science
      Repository, or a Google Drive link to an IIT faculty or graduate-student's paper, if you've
      opted to go that route.f
    deadline: 2020-04-02
  - action: Email the instructor with your final project deliverables.
    description: >

    deadline: *deadline
    details:
      - >
        A cover letter of no more than 1-2 pages addressed to the article’s author(s) explaining the
        editing work that you have done. The letter should prepare the authors to understand the
        changes you have suggested, and alert them to global/repeated queries that require internal
        consistency throughout the manuscript.
      - >
        A stylesheet that you create as you work through the manuscript to ensure its internal
        consistency. The style sheet should be comprehensible and useful for the author as well as
        anyone else involved in handling the manuscript through to publication. Be organized, be
        explicit, and of course, be consistent.
      - >
        A Google Doc of your marked-up article. In-text citation should match either the
        bibliography, author-date, or note style. For example, if the unedited manuscript uses a
        date-style system, use CMS author-date style.
      - >
        A self-critique memo of 2-3 paragraphs that evaluates your project and your progress in the
        class to this semester. You can write this in the body of your email.

You will edit a pre-publication academic manuscript for Project Three, including formatting its
citations and reference list or notes according to the Chicago Manual of Style. While you will of
course be working on sentence-level edits, keep in mind also issues of style, clarity, and the
consistency and overall organization of the manuscript. Query the author frequently; academics are a
special breed when it comes to feeling protective of their writing.

You will choose an in-progress article manuscript from one of the following sources:

1. The [Social Sciences Research Network](https://www.ssrn.com/index.cfm/en/) (SSRN)
  [Research Papers Series](https://www.ssrn.com/index.cfm/en/rps/). You can choose a manuscript from
  any of the SSRN’s subject areas, for example [this Working Paper Series
  list](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/JELJOUR_Results.cfm?form_name=journalBrowse&journal_id=2406088)
  for the Center for Latin American & Latino Studies (CLALS) . The paper you choose must be listed
  as appearing in a **Working Paper Series**. You cannot choose a paper in the Accepted Paper
  Series.
2. The [Open Science Repository](http://www.open-science-repository.com/) list of
  [Papers Open to Review](http://www.open-science-repository.com/open-science-blog.html).
3. With instructor permission, you can copyedit the in-progress pre-publication work of an IIT
  faculty member or graduate student.

You will find almost all of the research-repository papers are presented as PDFs. You will have to
clean up the PDF and present it as a Google Doc for digital markup.

You are responsible for editing the first 4000 words of the manuscript and the first 20 entries of
its bibliography/reference list or the first 20 note references, depending on the citation style the
paper uses. Refer to the <cite>Chicago Manual of Style</cite> for all matters of grammar and usage,
as well as for citation style and formatting.
